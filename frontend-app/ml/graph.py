"""
UPI Fraud Shield — Graph / Mule-Ring Detection
==============================================
Detects money-mule NETWORK patterns that a per-transaction (tabular) model
misses. Grounded in the canonical AML laundering motifs (IBM AMLworld /
NeurIPS 2023) that our research surfaced:

  - CHAIN / peeling : money forwarded A->B->C->D rapidly, amount ~conserved
  - CYCLE           : A->B->C->A (funds return to origin) -> strong launder sign
  - FAN-IN (hub)    : many senders -> one account (mule collection)
  - FAN-OUT         : one account -> many receivers (distribution)

IMPORTANT (honest framing, per research): a graph pattern is a SIGNAL, not
proof. A chain alone is NOT fraud (salary->rent looks like a chain). We only
score high when the pattern is RAPID + amount-CONSERVED + fresh — the mule
fingerprint, not normal money flow.

Pure NetworkX-style logic on an in-memory recent-edge window (real-time capable).
No GNN (research: GNN not guaranteed better + risky). Lightweight + explainable.
