"""
UPI Fraud Shield — Rule Layer
=============================
Fast, transparent rule-based signals with weights grounded in our research
(SIGNALS_MASTER.md / FRAUD_CASES). Catches known patterns instantly and gives
plain-English reasons WITHOUT needing the model — a reliable safety net that
also stays explainable.

Each rule adds points to a 0-100 rule score + a human reason.
This complements (not replaces) the XGBoost model + graph module.
